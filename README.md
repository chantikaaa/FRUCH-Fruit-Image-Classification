Through discussions, mentoring sessions, and collaborative teamwork, our team successfully developed FRUCH, a web application that predicts fruit ripeness and provides nutritional insights; contributing to food safety awareness for the community. This project was built by leveraging CNN-based machine learning with transfer learning.
Working on FRUCH gave me several key insights:
 - The importance of turning data into actionable solutions that solve real-world problems.
 - How machine learning models are not only about accuracy, but also usability and accessibility for end-users.
 - The value of team collaboration, by combining different strengths, from coding to design, to deliver one unified product.
 - The role of storytelling in tech, where every feature should connect back to why it matters for people.
From this capstone, I learned how to balance between technical complexity and practical impact. It wasn’t just about building an app—it was about creating a meaningful tool that people can actually use.
